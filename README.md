# Integrated Analysis of Socioeconomic and Health Metrics for Life Expectancy Insights

## Introduction

The "Integrated Analysis of Socioeconomic and Health Metrics for Life Expectancy Insights" project delves into the intricate relationships between various factors and their impact on life expectancy across different countries. By analyzing socioeconomic indicators, health metrics, and vaccination coverage, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of global health trends and promote healthier, longer lives for people around the world.

## Research Questions

This project seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. What is the relationship between life expectancy and vaccination coverage (BCG, MCV1, Pol3, DTP3) in different countries?
2. How does the percentage of urban and rural population impact life expectancy in different countries?
3. How do alcohol consumption and total expenditure on health impact life expectancy in different countries?
4. Which health indicators (HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, Diphtheria) have the most significant impact on life expectancy?
5. How has the infant mortality rate changed over time for different countries?

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

1. Gathered datasets from reliable sources, including life expectancy data, global food supply, urban and rural population percentages, vaccination coverage, GDP, and more.
- Life expectancy data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
- Global food: https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply
- Urban and rural population: Urbanization - Our World in Data
- Global Vaccination Coverage: Vaccination - Our World in Data
- Gross domestic product: Gross domestic product (GDP), 2020 (ourworldindata.org)
- Life expectancy vs GDP per capita:   Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita, 2018 (ourworldindata.org)

3. Cleaned and preprocessed the data by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
4. Combined datasets into a comprehensive dataset containing relevant information.

### Data Exploration

- Conducted descriptive analysis and data visualization to identify trends, patterns, and insights.
- Used Tableau to visualize relationships between life expectancy and factors like BMI, vaccination coverage, and urbanization.

### Data Analysis

- Formulated research questions based on initial exploration.
- Conducted in-depth analysis using Tableau to answer research questions and test hypotheses.

### Interpretation and Conclusion

- Summarized key findings and discussed implications for global health trends and life expectancy.
- Concluded the factors contributing to life expectancy variations.

## Conclusion

This project's findings emphasize the importance of understanding the complex interplay between socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables in influencing life expectancy. Insights gained from the analysis can inform policymakers and public health specialists, enabling targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and quality of life worldwide.

## Future Research Questions

The project opens the door for further investigation:

1. How do cultural factors impact life expectancy across countries?
2. What is the relationship between income inequality and life expectancy?
3. How does government healthcare expenditure correlate with life expectancy?
