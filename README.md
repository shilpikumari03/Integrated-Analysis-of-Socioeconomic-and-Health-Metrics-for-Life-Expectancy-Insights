# Integrated Analysis of Socioeconomic and Health Metrics for Life Expectancy Insights(Data Visualization Project)


## Introduction

The "Integrated Analysis of Socioeconomic and Health Metrics for Life Expectancy Insights" project aims to explore and understand the multifaceted relationships between socioeconomic indicators, health metrics, and life expectancy across different countries. By investigating factors such as BMI, GDP, health-related variables, vaccination coverage, and more, this project sheds light on the complexities that influence life expectancy and provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and public health organizations.

## Research Questions

This project seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. What is the relationship between life expectancy and vaccination coverage (BCG, MCV1, Pol3, DTP3) in different countries?
2. How does the percentage of urban and rural population impact life expectancy in different countries?
3. How do alcohol consumption and total expenditure on health impact life expectancy in different countries?
4. Which health indicators (HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, Diphtheria) have the most significant impact on life expectancy?
5. How has the infant mortality rate changed over time for different countries?

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

1. Gathered datasets from reliable sources, including life expectancy data, global food supply, urban and rural population, vaccination coverage, and GDP.
- life expectancy data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
- Global food: https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply
- Urban and rural population: Urbanization - Our World in Data
- Global Vaccination Coverage: Vaccination - Our World in Data
- Gross domestic product: Gross domestic product (GDP), 2020 (ourworldindata.org)
- Life expectancy vs GDP per capita:   Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita, 2018 (ourworldindata.org)

2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers that could affect the analysis.
3. Combined multiple datasets into a comprehensive dataset containing relevant information for the analysis.

### Data Exploration

1. Performed descriptive analysis to understand the variable distribution, identify trends, and gain insights.
2. Utilized Tableau to visualize data relationships, enabling exploration of life expectancy factors.

### Data Analysis

1. Formulated research questions based on initial data exploration.
2. Conducted in-depth analysis using Tableau to answer research questions and test hypotheses.

### Interpretation and Conclusion

1. Summarized key findings from data analysis and discussed implications for global health trends and life expectancy.
2. Concluded the significant factors contributing to life expectancy variations.

## Findings

The project revealed several important insights:

- There is a positive correlation between vaccination coverage and life expectancy, highlighting the importance of immunization programs.
- Countries with higher urban population percentages tend to have higher life expectancies, potentially due to improved healthcare access and quality in urban areas.
- Alcohol consumption is inversely related to life expectancy, while higher healthcare expenditure is associated with longer life spans.
- Health indicators such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, and Diphtheria significantly impact life expectancy.
- Infant mortality rates have decreased over time, contributing to improved life expectancy.

## Usage
Follow these steps to explore the Tableau visualizations and analyses in this project:
1. Install Tableau Desktop (If Not Installed):
- If you don't have Tableau Desktop installed, visit the Tableau website (https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) to download and install the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. Open Tableau Workbooks:

- In the project directory, navigate to the Tableau folder.
- You will find Tableau workbooks (*.twb files) related to different analyses and visualizations.
- Open Tableau Desktop and use the "Open" option to load a specific workbook from the Tableau folder.
  
3. Interact with Visualizations:

- Once the workbook is open, you can interact with the visualizations, dashboards, and analyses created for the project.
- Explore different tabs and sheets within the workbook to gain insights into various aspects of life expectancy and its influencing factors.

4. Modify and Customize:

- Feel free to modify the existing visualizations, add new ones, or customize the dashboards to suit your specific analysis needs.
- To modify a visualization, select a sheet, and use Tableau's intuitive interface to edit charts, filters, and parameters.
5. Save and Share:

- After making modifications or creating new visualizations, save your changes within Tableau Desktop.
- You can also export visualizations as images or interactive Tableau Public views to share with others.Open Tableau workbooks (`*.twb`) to explore visualizations and analyses.


## Future Research Questions

1. How do cultural factors impact life expectancy across countries, considering diet, lifestyle, and social support?
2. Is there a correlation between income inequality and life expectancy? How does income distribution influence life expectancy?
3. What is the relationship between government healthcare expenditure and life expectancy on a global scale?

## Conclusion

The "Integrated Analysis of Socioeconomic and Health Metrics for Life Expectancy Insights" project demonstrates the intricate interplay of factors influencing life expectancy. By identifying these connections, this project contributes to global health understanding, informs policy decisions, and encourages further research to improve health outcomes worldwide.
